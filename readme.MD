Slider for photos with the following properties:

1. It is possible to scroll through photos. 2 buttons forward and backward (previous, next and so on).
2. When you click "back" on the first photo, the last one opens. When you click "forward" on the last photo, the first one opens.
3. The block in which the images are located does not change to the size of the images.
4. Animation when switching photos.
5. At the input — an array of images. There can be any number of them. It is not tied to the ordinal number of the element.
6. Pictures can be put in the asset folder. Or use a third-party API by making a GET request to get images.
7. Semantic layout.
8. Tag selectors were not used to set styles. Classes and a selector by id were used.
9. The design is arbitrary. Minimum — the buttons are fixed (hover added) and accessibility is provided for them: switching by tab, outline, cursor.
